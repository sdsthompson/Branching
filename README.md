## Branching

This will list ways to branch, and notes on branching, and commands.

`git branch` - list branches, highlighting the one you're on.

`git branch BRANCH-NAME` - create your branch.

`git checkout BRANCH-NAME` - start working on that branch.

`git checkout -b BRANCH-NAME` - create a branch _and_ checkout that branch.
